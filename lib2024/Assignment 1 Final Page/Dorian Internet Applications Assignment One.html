				<h2><i>Sunday in the Park with George</i> is a Pulitzer-prize winning musical by celebrated composer Stephen Sondheim. The first act is a fictionalized account of the life of Georges Seurat during his painting of <i>Un dimanche après-midi à l'Île de la Grande Jatte</i>. The second is a wholly invented story about a descendant of Seurat's in 1982. The show as a whole is concerned with art, meaning, and creative legacy.
