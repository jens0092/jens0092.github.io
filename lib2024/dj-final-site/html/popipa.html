            <p class="maintext">In-fiction, Poppin'Party are a group of girls who met by chance and who started a band due to Kasumi Toyama's fervent desire to recapture the "sparkling, heart-pounding" feeling she gets when looking at the stars. Her passion for the experience of playing music convinced the others to join her, and they've been playing together ever since.</p>
            <p class="maintext">Outside the fiction, Poppin'Party was the first band to be revealed and to begin playing live shows, serving in many ways as the 'face' of the franchise. They play pretty uncomplicated anisong-style pop-rock, held together by the voice of Aimi, who plays Kasumi. When the franchise began, most members of Poppin'Party were just learning their instruments, but after six years of live performance they're all relatively skilled at this point.</p>
