            <p class="maintext">The <i>BanG Dream!</i> project is a Japanese multimedia franchise which began in 2016. Including animated films and television, a rhythm game, and live concerts, it is expansive -- and has grown over time. The franchise's primary focus is seven bands, four who regularly perform live and three who primarily exist in animated media, with members making only occasional live appearances. Through this site, I want to introduce you to those seven bands.</p>
            <p class="maintext">I've been a fan of the franchise since shortly after the rhythm game launched its English-language version, in April of 2018. I keep up with music releases and concerts, I follow the storyline of the fictional universe, and I own merchandise for a number of the bands. I think even if you're wholly uninterested in the fictional trappings, there's some fun music for people who like high-energy songs that cut across a variety of genres. My hope is that somewhere on this site you'll find at least one group you can become a fan of!</p>
