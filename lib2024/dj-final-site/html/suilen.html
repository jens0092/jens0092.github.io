            <p class="maintext">In-fiction, RAISE A SUILEN were recruited by wunderkind producer CHU2 to perform the music she composes. She drives them fiercely and was initially totally unconcerned with their subjective experience of being in a band, leading to tension and a lack of rapport between members. She has since matured significantly and the band have developed a bond of friendship.</p>
            <p class="maintext">RAISE A SUILEN actually began as a group of session musicians without characters in the franchise -- their role was to perform songs that were composed for the bands that don't do live shows. As such, the band's members were hired as musicians first and foremost. It wasn't until some time after the band was formed that they began performing original songs, and some time after that that it was announced they would be written into the franchise as characters in their own right.</p>
